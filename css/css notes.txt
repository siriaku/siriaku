syntax is:

<name of the element>{
  <style>:<value>;
}
example:
body{
 color: white;
}

there are 3ways you can write a css:
1.attribute/inline - this is given 1st priority
2.internal - this is given the second priority
3.external - this is given the least priority

relative path :  ../10_11_32/fff.jpg
absolute path : c://uiclass2016/uiclass/fff.jpg

syntax of attribute/inline:
style="<style>:<value>;<style>:<value>"

syntact for internal and external style:
<name of the element>{
   <style>:<value>;
}
===============================================
which is the best place to write styles?
head
-----------------------------------------------------
browsers understand RGB color space (red green blue)

0 - 255

red: 150
green : 150
blue : 0

border:
border-style
border-color
border-image
border-size
border-width
---------------------
the convention is:
border,style,color(2px solid #000)
border:<border><style><color>
----------------
2.display:
display is used to determine the display nature of the element.
there are several ways to display an element:
 	1. inline
	2.block
	3.inline-block
        4.table
	5.flex
	6.none
3.we can capture the attributes of html in our css file to apply styles to that perticular elements.

if there is id in html then use # in css

<element>[] -> target a specific <element>

every element in html has a background. the styles to background are similar to border

in css the comment is /*--------------*/
-------------------

ids canbe targetted using '#' its an unique

# -> id
. -> class

class attribute is used to share the same value across more than one elements/tages

Box model in class:
it creates a virtual "rectangular box" around the element which can be manipulated

border-style
border-width
border-color

border: 2px(width) solid(style) #ff0000(color)

margin-left
margin-right
margin-top
margin-bottom

border-radius,border,padding,   margin: 5px 2px 10px 5px;
	(top,right,bottom,left)
standardization was introduced in css box model and we have to follow.
margin: 50px 30px 50px 30px; this is equivalent to margin: 50px 30px;

border-radius:

border-top-left-radius
border-top-right-radius

if we want to get element center use margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;

in css we have certain styles to break off from the document flow(parent-child flow)
1.float - it breaks off from the document flow and puts the element either left or in right. it doest not support vertivcal break offs.
float: left
float: right
float: none

2.position - it too breaks off from the document flow but it maintains its document flow
there are several options for positions:
	1. relative  -- this is equivalent to saying that no position is needed

	2. fixed-- this fixes the element at that position regardless of document flow
	3. absolute-- this breaks off from the document flow and can be placed both vertically and horizontally using:
  top
  bottom
  left
  right

if i used fixed it fixes the element. if i use absolute we can move the elemnts using helper calsses like top bottom left and right

what is the style to put two divs side by side: float left and float right.
since div are block left elemtnts. 
width: inherit ----- block level elemet which use all the space 


different ways of selecting an element:

1<parent> <child>
2. nth-child
there are several properties when we add (:) to an element in css:
 1.hover
 2.focus
 3.blur
 4.visited
 5.nth-child
 6.first-child

<ul>
   <li></li>
   <li></li>
</ul>
